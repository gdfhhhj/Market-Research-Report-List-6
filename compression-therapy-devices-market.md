<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Compression Therapy Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Static Compression Therapy</li><li>Dynamic Compression Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Compression therapy devices are classified into two main types: static and dynamic compression therapy. Static compression therapy involves the application of consistent pressure to the affected area, typically using bandages or garments, to reduce swelling and improve circulation. In contrast, dynamic compression therapy utilizes inflatable devices that provide rhythmic pressure changes to promote blood flow and lymphatic drainage. Both types are essential in managing conditions like venous insufficiency, lymphedema, and post-surgical recovery, enhancing patient outcomes significantly.</p></p>
