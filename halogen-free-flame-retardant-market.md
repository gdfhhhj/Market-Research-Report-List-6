<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Halogen-Free Flame Retardant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aluminum Hydroxide</li><li>Organo-Phosphorus</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Halogen-Free Flame Retardants are essential additives used in various industries to inhibit or delay the spread of fire. Two common types of Halogen-Free Flame Retardants are Aluminum Hydroxide and Organo-Phosphorus. Aluminum Hydroxide works by releasing water vapor when exposed to heat, cooling the material and suppressing flames. Organo-Phosphorus compounds work by releasing phosphoric acid when exposed to high temperatures, creating a protective char layer that insulates the material from heat and oxygen, preventing combustion. Both types are effective alternatives to traditional halogen-based flame retardants.</p></p>
