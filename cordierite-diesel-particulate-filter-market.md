<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cordierite Diesel Particulate Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Pssive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cordierite Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) market is classified into active and passive systems. Active DPFs utilize external mechanisms, such as additional fuel injection or heating elements, to regularly regenerate and clean the filter by burning off accumulated soot. In contrast, passive DPFs rely on the exhaust temperature to achieve regeneration, often incorporating catalysts to lower the necessary temperature for soot oxidation. Both types are crucial for meeting emissions regulations and improving diesel engine efficiency.</p></p>
