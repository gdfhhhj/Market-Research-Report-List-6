<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Inkjet Printhead Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piezoelectric Type</li><li>Thermal Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial inkjet printhead market is primarily divided into two types: piezoelectric and thermal. Piezoelectric printheads utilize electrical currents to deform piezoelectric crystals, ejecting ink droplets with precision, making them ideal for various ink types and applications. In contrast, thermal printheads heat ink rapidly, creating vapor bubbles that force droplets out, suited for specific ink formulations. Both types serve distinct markets, with piezoelectric heads preferred for high-quality, versatile printing, while thermal heads are commonly used in cost-effective, high-speed printing scenarios.</p></p>
