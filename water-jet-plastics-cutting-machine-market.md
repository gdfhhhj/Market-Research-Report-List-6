<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water-jet Plastics Cutting Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Abrasive Water-jet</li><li>Pure Water-jet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Water-jet plastics cutting machines are divided into two main types - abrasive water-jet and pure water-jet. Abrasive water-jet machines use a mixture of water and abrasive particles to cut through hard materials such as metals and ceramics. On the other hand, pure water-jet machines use only water to cut softer materials like plastics and rubber. Each type of machine is suited to different applications based on the material being cut and the required precision of the cut.</p></p>
