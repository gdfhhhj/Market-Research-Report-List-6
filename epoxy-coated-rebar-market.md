<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Epoxy-Coated Rebar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Deformed Steel</li><li>Mild Steel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The epoxy-coated rebar market is primarily divided into two main types: deformed steel and mild steel. Deformed steel rebars have surface ridges that enhance their bond with concrete, providing superior tensile strength and resistance to slippage. They are commonly used in construction projects where structural integrity is crucial. Mild steel rebars, on the other hand, feature a smoother surface and are more malleable, making them suitable for projects requiring flexibility. Both types benefit from epoxy coating, which protects against corrosion and extends durability.</p></p>
